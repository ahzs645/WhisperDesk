## üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source

If you prefer to build from source or want to contribute to development:

### Setup
You can use the automated setup scripts or follow the manual steps:

**Automated Setup:**
*   **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<PROJECT_OWNER>/whisperdesk-enhanced.git
    cd whisperdesk-enhanced
    scripts/setup.sh
    ```
*   **Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/<PROJECT_OWNER>/whisperdesk-enhanced.git
    cd whisperdesk-enhanced
    scripts\setup.ps1
    ```
    *This script will guide you through installing dependencies and building the native whisper.cpp binary.*

**Manual Setup:**
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<PROJECT_OWNER>/whisperdesk-enhanced.git
    cd whisperdesk-enhanced
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    cd src/renderer/whisperdesk-ui
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    cd ../../..
    ```
3.  **Set up Whisper Binary:**
    Build the whisper.cpp native binary. This is often handled by the `setup.sh` or `setup.ps1` scripts.
    ```bash
    # Build from source (recommended for all platforms)
    npm run build:whisper
    ```
    *(Refer to `scripts/build-whisper.sh` for Unix or `scripts/compile-whisper-windows.ps1` for Windows for more details on the native build process).*
4.  **Download a Model:**
    Manually download a model if needed (the application can also do this via the UI).
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.config/whisperdesk-enhanced/models
    # Example: download the 'tiny' model
    wget https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-tiny.bin \
      -O ~/.config/whisperdesk-enhanced/models/ggml-tiny.bin
    ```

### Running (After Building from Source)
If you've built from source, you can run in development mode:

### Electron App (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev
```
**Features:** Full native integration, model downloads, persistent state, real-time progress

### Web Interface with Native Backend
```bash
npm run web
# Opens http://localhost:3000 with live transcription
```
**Features:** Web-based UI with native whisper.cpp backend

### API Server Only
```bash
npm run server
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash

## üéÆ User Guide

This section assumes you have followed either the "Download & Install" or "Build from Source" instructions above.

### General Usage
1.  **Launch WhisperDesk Enhanced.**
2.  **Download a Model:** If you haven't already, go to the "Models" tab and download a transcription model. "Whisper Tiny" (approx. 39MB) is recommended for first-time use due to its small size.
3.  **Transcribe Audio:**
    *   Navigate to the "Transcribe" tab.
    *   Drag and drop your audio/video file onto the application or click "Select Audio File".
    *   Click "Start Transcription".
4.  **View Results:** The transcription will appear in real-time. Results and progress persist even if you switch tabs within the application.

### Best Practices
- **Use Pre-built Releases**: Fastest and most reliable way to get started
- **Start with Tiny model**: Fastest download and good for initial testing
- **Use drag & drop**: Easiest way to select and upload files
- **Monitor progress**: Stay in tab or navigate freely - progress persists
- **Check for Updates**: The app will notify you of new releases automatically
- **Check History tab**: View current session and manage transcribed files
