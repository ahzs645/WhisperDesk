00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
 You're invited to a real English conversation with me and my husband Dan.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.240
 We're gonna be talking about education today.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.080
 You asked us your top education questions in English

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.200
 and we're going to have a chat about those questions

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.480
 and mercy you in English and I hope you will end up on the other side of this conversation

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.800
 with a higher level of vocabulary.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.280
 More confidence about speaking in English and you'll enjoy it along the way.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.360
 And like always, I've created a free PDF worksheet which is over Dan's face at the moment

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.720
 with all of today's important vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.600
 everything that you're going to hear in the lesson you will get in the free PDF worksheet.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.240
 So you can click on the link in the description to download that free PDF worksheet today.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.360
 All right Dan, are you ready to get started with the first question that our students have asked us?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.200
 I'm ready to get educated.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.080
 All right, let's do it. These education questions were asked by my student,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.120
 Carmen from Italy and Maiji in Australia. Are you ready for the first one?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.480
 I'm ready. All right, the first question is what age does school start in the US?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.560
 That's where we're from, the US. And what does the education system look like?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.920
 So let's start with the first question. What age does school start in the US?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.520
 Yeah, so a lot of kids go to some kind of school around four years old.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.360
 So this would be preschool. And in a lot of cases, this is not provided by the state.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.720
 Yeah, this is something that parents have to pay for out of pocket.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.960
 Mm-hmm. And I would say this is like kind of like daycare except maybe a little more education

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 peppered in because they're really little kids. Yeah. And then official school is kindergarten

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.400
 which starts around five or six years old. Yeah. And this is where real school begins.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.040
 We're sitting and trying to learn our letters and alphabet reading. And here's numbers and all that kind of thing.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.160
 Yeah. And then elementary school would be first through fifth grade. Yeah, first through fifth grade.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.960
 Which is probably what seven to eleven or twelve. Yeah. Yeah. Something like that.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.480
 And here's old. Yep. And then it moves on to middle school, which is everybody's favorite time of

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.400
 existence 12 to 14. This is like straight example of sarcasm. Oh, yes, this is sarcasm.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.000
 Yeah, middle school. Not known for being the most fun time. And no, it's funny because a lot of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.400
 kids are like moving at this time. Like they're going in. They could be going to a different school

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 different classes. Yeah. And then you're going through the awkward time in your life.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 Yeah. Here's some other new people for you. It'll be fun. So yeah, that's an interesting time.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.600
 Usually middle school has the stereotype of being pretty rough. Pretty tricky. And then after middle school is

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.080
 high school. And by that point, you're what like 14 years old. You're a real man. Like 14 through 18 years old.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.680
 So you're not right. The beginning, the cusp of puberty instead, you're a little further in.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.920
 And maybe a little more mature. Maybe ninth grade is still at awkward. The ninth grade is still

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.640
 because you're, you know, when you're in ninth grade and you're like 14 or 15. And then you see like a 17 or 18 year old.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.400
 A lot of the, especially if you're a guy like me, puberty can hit all the sudden. And then you'll be a man

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.120
 versus like I was a boy. A little boy when you're ninth grade. Oh, guys.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.760
 Yeah. So this is the typical progression of school. And there's a couple different options in the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 US. You could go to public school, which is free. It's paid for by your taxes. So if you pay taxes,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.640
 it's technically not free. Free not free. Yeah. So free not free. It's paid for by the state.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.520
 You go to public school. You could go to a public charter school. So this is kind of a nuance where

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:59.520
 you don't have to pay extra to go to a charter school. But it's somehow, it's run privately.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.440
 It's run privately. It's smaller. Usually the programs have a little bit higher quality. And to get into a

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.240
 charter school, you often need to do a lottery. And this isn't like the lottery where you try to win a million dollars.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.960
 This is where you just sign up and they pull a kid's name out of a hat. Totally random. And if you get it,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.640
 you get it. And if you don't, you don't. So it's not based on your income. It's not based on where you live.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.200
 Because most private or most public schools are based on where you live. You have to go to the school

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.040
 in your neighborhood. Yeah. But a charter school. Yeah, especially if you live in an area that's really poor.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.680
 Well, your school is probably not going to be very high quality. And there's a lot of controversy

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.240
 about that because it's kind of a cycle. Yeah, it's definitely a cycle. You don't have as many resources

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.760
 to get out of poverty and all of that. So we've got public school, charter school, private school.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.800
 I have a little statistic here. I looked up at advanced fancy private schools. 9% of students

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.720
 go to a private school and parents have to pay extra for a private school. It could be a religious

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.080
 private school. It could be a secular private school. Our child Theo. He's probably in the one

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.800
 percent because he goes to a nature school. It's not really a point five percent. It's a very unusual

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.360
 private school. But there's also other types of private schools. Like in nature school where

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.840
 half of the day they spend time outside in the woods or the teachers try to incorporate

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.040
 the outside nature into the lessons. A lot of times these schools will call themselves alternative

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.560
 education. So that just means we're trying to do something different here. Yeah. And there's

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.200
 varying degrees of quality. Just because you're paying for it doesn't mean that it's going to be

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.160
 vastly better quality than the free public school. So if you come to the US and you think I want my

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.440
 kid to have the best education, I think I can afford to pay for private school. Make sure you check it

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.480
 out first and make sure that it's actually the quality that you want. There are a lot of scholarships

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.680
 actually. So the school that our son goes to, a lot of people have an 80% scholarship to go to the

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.320
 school, which makes it very affordable. The state has scholarships. The school provides some scholarships.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.360
 There's some grants given to the school to provide scholarships. So they're trying to make it more

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.560
 accessible. Yeah. Most schools, especially private schools and anything education related,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.000
 you're going to find a lot of organizations that will try to help kids get into whatever they really

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.720
 really want. And the government helps with that as well. Yeah. America. I think a lot of it comes

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.440
 down to the parents having the ability to sign up, follow through with the applications, sign up for the

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.280
 scholarship. It doesn't mean it's easy. It doesn't mean it's easy, but it is an option. There's a

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:01.520
 fourth option, which is what Dan experienced when he was a child. Home schooling. Look at me. So

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.960
 interestingly enough, what percent of Americans do you think homeschool? This means that generally

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.520
 don't peak your mom or what I learned in homeschool. Your mom or your dad is your teacher. Usually

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.240
 your mom. And there's like local organizations that you can join weekly, like a co-op. They call it a homeschooling

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:30.960
 co-op. What percent of American children are homeschooling as of 2021? Well, I would have guessed

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:39.040
 it was very low. See, I think I looked at your phone earlier and saw it. Well, you showed it to me,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.520
 but I would have guessed like 2%. Okay. Before seeing that. Okay. But I think it's higher. Yes,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.280
 the answer is 7%. Which is pretty high? It's almost the same amount as go to private school.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.760
 Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, so 7% and the interesting thing. I guess it probably bumped up after

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:05.440
 COVID too. Yes, that's the big thing. So before COVID it was, I think, 4% or 5%. And now it's 7%.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:12.800
 And it's growing 10% every year. So it's hard to talk about those stats. And it's growing every

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.400
 year because of all the changes in education. Yeah. And our public schools gotten kind of like a

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.840
 bad reputation as well. I mean, there's varying qualities, but a lot of people where they live,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:30.000
 their school is not very good. And it's not just teachers. It's also like the pears you're with.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.520
 And it's kind of, I don't know. I mean, obviously I teach at an alternative school. So I don't,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.520
 I'm not a big fan of the traditional model. And I don't like all the bureaucracy and not to say that

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.320
 there's not a lot of good-hearted people in the system. I just think that the system is well,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.920
 it's in my sound a little cliche, but it's broken. Yeah. So those are the general options in

00:08:51.920 --> 00:09:00.080
 the US. And I think the cool thing is that if you choose an alternative option, private school, charter

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.160
 school, homeschooling, it's not seen as very weird. It's unusual. It's not the majority,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.160
 but you're not like at outcast. You're not so weird. Oh my goodness, you homeschool. It's not like that,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.200
 generally. It's just, okay, someone does something different. I think that's kind of like in the American

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.720
 culture. That is a very much an American culture thing. Yeah, you accept people try to accept people who do

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.960
 different things. And because we lived in South Korea for a while, like we felt that difference so big,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.720
 like we never met anybody who homeschooled there. We met like one family. Yeah. Like wow,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.080
 this is amazing. Yeah, like everyone uses the same education system and deviating from that norm is

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.560
 really unusual. Yeah, or even looked down on. But in America, if you do something different like that,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.160
 people, they may like sometimes go and like whisper about it or like say, I don't really agree with that,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.600
 but they'll never tell you to your face. Yeah. That they have a problem with that just like a decision

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.280
 you might make, especially in a personal decision. Dan was homeschooled until how old? Yes, until

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:11.040
 13. I think yes, until middle school. And that's pretty cool. Yes. And I feel like homeschooling

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.320
 today is way better than it was when I was a kid. Way more resources. I think that what I

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:24.960
 experienced, I don't want for my kids, but today I can kind of feasibly see how you can build up certain

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.680
 social exposures, have certain groups. There's a ton of resources online. Yeah. And your mom certainly

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.040
 did the best that she did. Oh yeah, my mom did a good job. I think it was just for me personally.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.440
 I don't think it fit what I probably needed as a child. Looking back. I needed more pressure

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:50.880
 July. I needed a deadline. I needed another authority other than my mom. And I needed better like a

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:57.120
 bigger social circle. And a little more structured education. I thought I would think would have been

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.080
 good for me. Not that my mom wasn't somewhat structured, but it's just a different kind of thing.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.640
 Yeah, homeschooling in the 90s compared to homeschooling now 30 years later. That's crazy. All right,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.760
 let's go on to question number two. Do most American students go to universities after their graduation?

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.040
 Is it considered important? Let's talk about like our general feel first and then I've got some

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.240
 stats about how many people actually go. I haven't looked at the stats this time. I didn't make

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.080
 it that far. Let's hear what's inside your heart, Dan. So I think, yes, people generally go to

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:39.600
 we would say college, but I think a lot of the world would say university. I don't know the percentage,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.080
 but I would say what's your guess? What's your guess? It's a good talk. 80th. No, 75 percent.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:55.760
 Wow, really. Yeah. Okay. What is it? Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's 92 percent, 61 percent.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.920
 I think this is showing your bias because I don't know which way the bias is. Let's say that

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:10.000
 so for us, we have a four-year degree and that's what you call it when you go to a college for four years.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.240
 You could have a two-year degree. It's called an associate's degree or a four-year degree.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.960
 And we have four-year degrees. And I think there's been some studies that show like,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:25.040
 if you have a four-year degree, most of the people in your social circle also have the same

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.720
 or close to the same level of education. Yeah. Everybody I know is edging McKay.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:35.360
 So that's why you think it's so high. Yeah. I should have thought about that. Okay. So in

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:43.600
 let's compare 1990 to 19 or to 2021. Okay. In 1990, the people who graduated high school

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.640
 were 77 percent. So 70 percent of students graduated from high school and 20 percent

00:12:50.640 --> 00:13:00.160
 of people graduated from college. Okay. 2021-91 percent of people graduated from high school.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.640
 So much higher percentage rate and 38 percent of people graduated from high school. Yeah. So it is

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:13.600
 higher. And all of the charts that I saw were all going up. So finishing high school and college

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:20.640
 are definitely on the rise, not 70 percent would ever be said. But it probably is 70 percent of the

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.520
 people we know, which I think is quite interesting. And that's kind of part of the cycle of education.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.280
 I think that if you don't know anyone who's been to college, it probably won't be a priority for you.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.480
 And it will be harder for you to go because you won't have people who know how that process works

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.520
 and all of that. But if you've been to college, like us, it will be easier for our kids to do

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:47.440
 that process because we've been. Yes. I'm glad I could be instructive of a fallacy. You know,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.400
 but my personal experience. Well, thanks for being willing to be the fallacy in front of millions of

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.320
 people. Yes. You're welcome, everybody. But this is also a part two of the question. Is it considered

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:05.440
 important? Oh, well, again, this probably goes to your social circle because in my social circle,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.720
 it was super important. And I think this is probably family by family. I would say it's almost

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.400
 expected if your parents are college graduates. It's almost expected. Of course, you're going to college.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:23.840
 However, I think I have heard from certain like our neighbor. I think she said she was the first to go to

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:30.400
 college. And like it was like looked upon as like great, but it wasn't like expected. And

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:39.520
 but as a society, it is definitely encouraged. Like, you know, there's ads playing on the TV and

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.760
 YouTube and every teacher will tell you going to college. I'm just going to say university because more

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.600
 people say they're going to university is going to be a great benefit to your life and all this kind

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.360
 of stuff. So I think that is definitely pushed in society. That probably is another reason why I think

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:04.560
 that a lot of people go. But I'm also forgetting about how expensive it is. Yeah, that's the other thing

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:15.200
 is that it's really expensive. I would say anywhere between 30,000 and $200,000 for a four-year degree

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.400
 depending on if you go to a community college or if you go to a state school or if you go to a private

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:27.280
 school, it can range anywhere in there. And that's a big burden for a young person starting off in their

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:34.640
 career to have to pay. The state schools aren't cheap or free. They're not cheap and they're not free.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:40.720
 Okay, they're cheaper than private schools. Yeah. It's a very complicated system, but I think I'm a

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.800
 little ignorant in this realm because I haven't thought about college in a while, but you know,

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.680
 we went to a small private school and like that's known for being like pretty expensive. Yeah,

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.840
 yeah, but for me, I had to get a lot of scholarships to go to that school. So I like applied for

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.120
 tons of scholarships. The school also had scholarships and it was pretty much required. If I was

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:10.000
 going to go to that school, I had to have a lot of money already paid for. Otherwise, it was just

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.360
 too expensive. But I think it's interesting because of our experience, we felt if I can speak for you

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:22.320
 too, we felt pretty burdened even though we had scholarships, we felt pretty burdened post college to pay back

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:29.280
 or student loans. When you start off your life, your adult life in debt, that's so hard. In my

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.880
 parents tried so hard. They paid a lot of money. I had a lot of scholarships and I still had college

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.960
 debt that I had to pay back. So even though I think I was probably starting off in the best possible

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:48.080
 position, it still felt like a burden. So I think for us, at least for our children, I have no idea what the

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:56.960
 education scene will look like in another 15 years. But I think that we might have a different perspective

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:04.000
 on college because we've been there. We know what it's like. We know if it helped us or not in our

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.600
 life and how expensive it is and if it's worth it. Like are there other alternatives? Yeah, and in our changing

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.320
 world, those might be better. I don't know. I think it's a cliche among people our age that college

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:24.160
 is not worth it. Yeah. And that it's just way too expensive for what you get out of it and it doesn't

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:35.120
 really prepare you and all this stuff. I think if you graduated like 2005 to 2010, around that,

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:42.880
 maybe even 15 in that range, you probably feel like us that your degree does not mean you will get

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:51.440
 a good paint job. It's not a given that that will happen. Yeah. I think initially when we went to

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.520
 college, there was like a transitional phase where everything was getting, it was getting a lot more expensive

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:05.600
 and that cost benefit analysis was maybe making less sense. But a lot of our families were still

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.400
 saying the same message that you just have to go even if you're not even sure what you want to do,

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.920
 which was in my case, which I think didn't help me. Yeah. Well, my job didn't even exist when I

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:23.200
 went to college. Yeah. This job teaching English online was not even an option. So yeah. It's tricky.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.760
 Yeah. And I don't know exactly what the future, I don't know what the future holds. But I

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.400
 feel like the world changes really, really fast in that I will certainly not tell my children they

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.280
 have to go to college. And that like this will make all the difference. I'll be like, well what exactly

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.080
 do you want to do? Let's get in that program. Let's look at the cost benefit analysis of how

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.880
 much it costs and like really dig in there. Unfortunately, I don't feel like my parents did that.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:57.200
 But their generation really was the last generation who said, I'll get a university degree,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:04.160
 and that will give me a good job and it worked. So their expectation was what happened to them.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.600
 But that's not how it is now. Anyway, who knows what will happen in the next 10 to 15 years for

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.880
 our kids, but I certainly won't pressure them. And I won't feel disappointed if they decide not to go

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.480
 to college as long as they are independent adults, you know, trying to do something different. And

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:27.120
 I'm going to transition to the last question and skip one question. I'm actually because it's

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.880
 a, I think you're about to say something about it. Oh, I'm going to guess. Because it has to do with

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.600
 what happens if you don't get a college degree? Is it hard to find a job if you don't have

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.480
 a university degree? Um, I did a little bit of research about this, but what's your gut say?

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:49.120
 If you don't get a university degree, is it harder to get a job? Yeah. Yeah. Like if you didn't have

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:56.960
 a degree right now, would your prospects be more difficult? It probably is. I don't think it has to be,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:03.600
 but I do think that I don't know if I've actually read a study about this, but I think I heard in a podcast

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.760
 that that is like something that employers will look at and they'll be like, "All right, check off for

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.200
 four-year degree, like they'll just kind of assume that that means a lot." So I do think it does

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.880
 mean something, unfortunately, I don't think it has to be. I think that you can probably

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.720
 really get well-educated without it. Definitely. Nowadays, and I think that might even be

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.480
 preferable when you consider how much it costs. So other than like, there's a lot of social

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:39.040
 experiences, however a lot of the social experiences are like getting really drunk and misbehaving.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.280
 Yeah, that doesn't really have anything to do with the stupid type. The stupid type of American

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.640
 college is that you just go there, get drunk, sleep with a lot of people, and then maybe you stumble

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.440
 into class once a week. Yeah, it doesn't really make any sense. And then you pay lots of money for that.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.680
 That wasn't my college experience, but that is certainly- Oh, it was there. It would certainly

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:03.360
 what happens to a lot of people. Right. So yeah, but I'm still saying that it does, unfortunately,

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:09.840
 probably still matter. Yeah, I would say that that's probably the case for specific careers.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.520
 So what I saw was like, you know, of course, if you're going to be a doctor, if you're going to be an

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.800
 engineer, if you're going to be like in the medical field, you're those very specific technical type of

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:25.280
 jobs that require education. That education is probably necessary. But for other careers,

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:31.760
 what I read online said is a college degree necessary. Yes, and no. The yes was if you want to be in

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:38.560
 those specific career fields. Yeah, if you're going to be a nurse, go get a degree in nursing, and you'll be

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.040
 fine. I think it's actually even a two-year degree. Yeah, that's amazing. That's not preferable to me like

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.000
 some kind of two-year program. I feel like you can learn, maybe not anything, but a lot of things

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.240
 in two years. But it didn't have to be four years. But it said, if you want a job that usually says,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:00.240
 we require a degree, or they highly recommend a degree in their application, maybe like a software

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:06.720
 engineer or something like this, if you are an assertive person who has done a lot of alternative

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.360
 experiences, now this takes a specific personality type, I think. God, I had something for that

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:19.520
 resume. Yes, you have a good resume. You've interned. You have maybe taken some extra curricular classes

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:26.080
 at the local college, or maybe even some online courses about that specific field. It doesn't have to be

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.640
 a lot of alternatives out there. Yeah, that you can buy your assertiveness, which is really what people are

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.240
 looking for often. People who will see a problem and fix the problem. The skills can really be taught,

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:44.160
 but that personality and character quality can't be taught as much. So if you show that,

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.080
 then you could get in. So for example, this isn't about a job. This is about getting into college.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:57.920
 There was a homeschooler who had been homeschooled their entire life, and they wanted to get into a

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:03.200
 huge university. I don't think it was Harvard, but it was like a really high level university.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:10.080
 And what they did instead, they wrote out, of course, every charity they worked with,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.760
 every volunteer experience, all of this, but they also wrote a list. The second page of their application

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:23.120
 was 100 books that I read last year. Holy cow, that's like two books a week. They wrote out

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.160
 everything that they had read. And in order and all of this, and it showed their assertiveness,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.400
 I'm going to be a good student. I'm going to be dedicated. And I think for a lot of jobs,

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:39.360
 if you can be outstanding like that, then who cares if you have a degree? Ideally. A little example

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:47.600
 too is someone who works for me. Laura, Hi, Laura. If you're watching, she helps to write some of the

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.920
 sales content, like sales emails. She's called a copywriter. When I interviewed her,

00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:00.400
 I don't even know if she has a college degree. I don't even know her official education,

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:08.320
 but her application process, her experience, and she had taken the initiative to do some

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:16.480
 online copywriting classes, and had been working on and off for some other businesses doing their

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.040
 writing as well. So she had this kind of initiative. And that's really what I was looking for,

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.480
 was someone who was organized, took the initiative, creative, and was interested in the job.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.880
 They had taken some classes of her own volition and really done it. And that's why I hired her.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.800
 Yeah. And she's been amazing. Actually, a lot of my students who join my courses, they say that their

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.880
 job didn't require them to take English classes, but they write on their resume, completed

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:52.960
 three-month English course with Vanessa. And this is like the urine institution. It's not

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.240
 a four-year degree. It's not in Isle Certificate. Something official like that, but it shows that

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:05.360
 you took the initiative. I think she's pretty official. And it showed that you're willing to go the

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:11.840
 extra mile and to try to do your best. So I think that's a good example of a way that's extra

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.760
 curricular education can enhance your career as well. Well, talking about internships, I'm curious

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:23.680
 in your country. Is it common to do an internship? I think in Germany, it's maybe required

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:29.600
 that you do a year internship after high school. And it's like part of this system. I'm not sure if

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.600
 you're from Germany, let me know. That sounds like a better system to me. I don't know if that's

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:41.040
 real real world experience in the world. Yeah. Doing something. But I feel like for me that would have

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:48.720
 been pretty helpful just to kind of get out of the education system. I felt very overwhelmed going

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.880
 from high school to four years of college. And then I had had part-time jobs working in restaurants and

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:01.760
 these types of things. But nothing like a career. And by my third year of college, I just felt like,

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.800
 I just want to go out into the real world and try to get a job. I don't want to do something.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.600
 Yeah, I want to do something. And it's not common in the US to take a gap here. This is a common

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.520
 thing. I think in Europe and Australia that after high school students will take a gap year.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.440
 And go out and do something. Good job, Europe. Go be a nanny. Go volunteer at a farm.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:30.400
 Yeah, I think when we were in South East Asia, do something. When we were in France that one year,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.600
 we did meet some younger people who seem to either be taking a gap here or do some kind of

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:41.440
 intern thing. I don't know. I like that a lot. In the US, it's kind of strange that you graduate

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.640
 high school. And you have this big ceremony. And congratulations, you get to move on to more

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:53.680
 school. Yeah, I pretty much guarantee that if you were in the US and you graduated from high school,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.880
 and you said, I'm going to take a gap year. And then I'll decide what I want to do. Every single

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:06.480
 person will say, if you don't go to college now, you're never going to do it. This is your chance to do it now,

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.400
 because you'll forget about it or you won't have the motivation to do it or you'll forget about

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:16.480
 education and forget about math, these types of things. But in reality, if you're not meant to

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.560
 go to college and you wait a year and you decide not to go to college, well, maybe that was a better path for you.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:28.160
 I don't know. I feel a little biased because I saw people doing that Europeans who were doing that

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.600
 gap year and I felt really jealous. I would have loved to do that. But it's just not an American

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.960
 culture. Maybe it might start becoming part of it as we kind of learn more about Europe or like

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.000
 10 years behind Europe in those things. But right now, it's not part of American culture.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.040
 You just do school, possibly more school. Or stop school. Pay back your school with your job.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.080
 So that's it. All right. Well, thanks for talking to me today about education. You're welcome.
