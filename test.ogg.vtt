00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
 Tell you, basically what this is about is when I was watching Harvey McKay that one of

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.880
 Harvey Eckers' things, he said he'd just finished the Boston Marathon and you know the guy's

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:21.680
 76 and they went, "Holy crap, you know, that's amazing." He looked so fit and he so quick minded

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.760
 and so on. I thought, "All of a sudden I'd occurred to me, I bet the way you eat."

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.440
 You know, is different. I bet you don't just eat a bunch of garbage and that started this thought.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.840
 So the basic three questions will be and I'm recording it for you as well if I transcribed these

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.800
 for the book but then I write about it and what's really been neat about it is that what started out

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.640
 is three same questions to everybody. Everybody had kind of a different angle on it and I realized

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 that they were creating the chapters for this book. And of course Marcie Shime offered me the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.160
 right accent. I'm not doing something where I did all the work and you're just transcribing it.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.400
 But if you actually write in the book, I'll do it. So I made her that promise.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 And it was a hard promise but it was a good one to make because it made me think more, you know.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 So what I would do is I basically introduce you and then you can add anything

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.720
 that you think is important to that introduction and let me get my history up here because I have

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 you on here. So how's Robbie doing? Good hanging in there. Yeah. Did you guys have a nice holiday?

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.760
 Well, he actually cut out a cruddy holiday hurt father who was very old got sick and then

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.760
 I pissed him away. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. But you know stuff happens. What are you going to do?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.680
 Okay. So I'm going to, is your best website we're going to, at the end I'm going to ask you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.000
 know about your website and stuff is RickFrishman.com the best one to go to or

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.720
 yeah, probably just for most stuff that's probably the best way to go. Yeah. You had a really good

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.520
 bio on one of your websites. It's up there. It is one. You know, I'm most of them. I saw RickFrishman

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.600
 blog.com. You know. Hey, it's RickFrishman. Well, let me check that out. I'm so happy you made it here.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:47.600
 Okay. So the, there we go about Rick. Yeah. So, you know,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.000
 one of the things that that I'll bring up is, you know, you always talk about how you have the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.640
 biggest roller decks. And I thought that was a really cool angle too because part of part of success

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.360
 is who you know. And I, you know, I think that's important. I don't know what your, what your angle

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.160
 is going to be on this. But the, you know, the questions will be, um, do you think that that hypothesis

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.080
 is true that, you know, food affects your ability to succeed on some level? And then if you,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.560
 you know, if it plays into into your level of success. In other words, you know, I know there

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.760
 there are successful people who eat crappy food. But so far, kind of the consensus has been,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.720
 you know, it's, it's run the gamut of extremes. But, but so far, people seem to say, you know,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.440
 they can't keep up their energy. If you speak a lot, you do a lot of speaking. So, you know,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.040
 and you have a pectic schedule. So I imagine that if you're, you know, full of two pizzas,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:04.320
 you probably don't have the energy on stage that you normally would. So that's kind, that's kind of

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.820
 into the angle.
