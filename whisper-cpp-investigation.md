# Whisper.cpp Release Investigation

## Findings from GitHub Releases

- Latest release: v1.7.5 (April 2, 2025)
- Repository: https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp
- The releases do not contain pre-built binaries for different platforms
- Only source code archives are provided (Source code.zip and Source code.tar.gz)

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Build from source**: Download source and compile whisper.cpp locally
2. **Use existing binaries**: Look for community-provided binaries
3. **Fallback approach**: Use Python whisper as fallback when native binary is not available

## Recommended Solution

Since pre-built binaries are not available, we should:
1. Modify the binary manager to build from source when needed
2. Provide fallback to Python whisper when native binary is not available
3. For testing purposes, we can skip the binary download and focus on the model download functionality

## Next Steps

1. Update binary manager to handle missing binaries gracefully
2. Test the model download functionality in the browser
3. Use the existing Python whisper provider as fallback
