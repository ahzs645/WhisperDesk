# üöÄ Development & Contributing Guide

WhisperDesk Enhanced welcomes contributions! This guide provides information on setting up your development environment, building the application, and contributing to the project.

## For Contributors & Developers

### Development Setup
Details for setting up a development environment are covered in the "üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source" section in the main [README.md](../README.md#Ô∏è-build-from-source). Key steps include:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<PROJECT_OWNER>/whisperdesk-enhanced.git
    cd whisperdesk-enhanced
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    This installs dependencies for the Electron app and the Vite/React frontend.
    ```bash
    npm install
    cd src/renderer/whisperdesk-ui
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps # --legacy-peer-deps might be needed for some UI library compatibility
    cd ../../..
    ```
3.  **Build/Set up the Native `whisper.cpp` Binary:**
    The application relies on a native `whisper.cpp` command-line executable. The automated setup scripts (`scripts/setup.sh` or `scripts/setup.ps1`) usually handle this.
    To build it manually or understand the process:
    ```bash
    npm run build:whisper
    ```
    This command typically invokes:
    *   `scripts/build-whisper.sh` on macOS/Linux
    *   `scripts/compile-whisper-windows.ps1` on Windows

    These scripts compile the `whisper.cpp` source code (often included as a submodule or downloaded) into an executable located in the `binaries` directory.

4.  **Running in Development Mode:**
    Once setup is complete, you can start the application in development mode with hot reloading for the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Building Releases
To build distributable packages for different platforms:

```bash
# Build all components (compiles frontend, prepares main process code)
npm run build

# Create distribution packages for your current platform
npm run dist

# (If configured) Build for all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
npm run dist:all
```
These scripts use Electron Builder to package the application into installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`), AppImages, or other platform-specific formats. Configuration for Electron Builder can be found in `package.json` or a dedicated builder configuration file (e.g., `electron-builder.yml`).

### Development Workflow
Here are some common commands used during development:

*   **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Electron application with the frontend in hot-reload mode. This is the primary command for UI development.
*   **`npm run web`**: If you want to test the web interface version (which uses `transcription-server.js` as a backend), this command typically starts the Vite dev server for the UI and the separate backend server.
*   **`npm run server`**: Starts only the backend API server (`transcription-server.js`) if you want to interact with it directly or use a different frontend.
*   **`npm run test:native`**: Executes tests for the native services, ensuring the `whisper.cpp` binary and related functionalities are working correctly.
*   **`npm run build:whisper`**: Specifically rebuilds the `whisper.cpp` native binary.
*   **Linting/Formatting**: Check `package.json` for linting and formatting scripts (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to maintain code quality.

### Available Build Targets
The application can be built for the following platforms and formats:

*   **Windows**:
    *   `NSIS Installer (.exe)`
    *   `Portable .exe`
*   **macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)**:
    *   `.dmg` disk images for `x64` (Intel) and `arm64` (Apple Silicon) architectures.
    *   Universal DMG may also be configured.
*   **Linux**:
    *   `.AppImage` (portable, works on most distributions)
    *   `.deb` (for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems)
    *   `.rpm` (for Fedora/Red Hat-based systems)

Build targets are defined in the Electron Builder configuration.

### Contributing Guidelines

We appreciate contributions from the community! To ensure a smooth process, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the `whisperdesk-enhanced` repository on GitHub.
2.  **Create a Feature Branch**: For new features or bug fixes, create a descriptive branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/add-new-export-format` or `fix/transcription-error-handling`).
3.  **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or bug fix.
    *   Ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions.
    *   Add or update tests if applicable.
4.  **Test Your Changes**:
    *   Run the application locally and test the functionality you've added or modified.
    *   If possible, test on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    *   Run any relevant test scripts (e.g., `npm run test:native`).
5.  **Update Documentation**: If you've added new features or changed existing behavior, update any relevant documentation (README, other docs files).
6.  **Commit Your Changes**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
7.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
    *   Push your feature branch to your fork.
    *   Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the original `whisperdesk-enhanced` repository.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the changes and why they are being made. Reference any related issues.
8.  **Ensure CI Passes**: The project likely uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI). Ensure all automated checks and builds pass for your PR. Address any failures.
9.  **Code Review**: Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments based on feedback from maintainers.
