# Screen Recorder Code Centralization and Restructuring

## Overview

The screen recorder functionality has been completely restructured and centralized into a modular, maintainable system. This migration improves code organization, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Directory Structure

Created a centralized screen recorder system at `src/main/screen-recorder/`:

```
src/main/screen-recorder/
├── core/
│   └── ScreenRecorderEngine.js      # Core recording logic
├── managers/
│   ├── DeviceManager.js             # Device discovery and validation
│   └── FileManager.js               # File operations and storage
├── handlers/
│   └── ScreenRecorderHandlers.js    # Centralized IPC handlers
├── types/
│   └── index.js                     # Type definitions and constants
├── ScreenRecorderService.js         # Main orchestrator service
├── index.js                         # Entry point and factory
└── README.md                        # Documentation
```

### 2. Component Separation

**Before**: Single monolithic files
- `src/main/services/screen-recorder.js` (417 lines)
- `src/main/ipc-handlers/screen-recorder-handlers.js` (339 lines)
- Mixed responsibilities and concerns

**After**: Modular components with clear responsibilities
- **ScreenRecorderEngine**: Core recording logic and state management
- **DeviceManager**: Device discovery, validation, and permissions
- **FileManager**: File operations, storage, and cleanup
- **ScreenRecorderService**: Main orchestrator that coordinates all components
- **ScreenRecorderHandlers**: Centralized IPC communication

### 3. Key Improvements

#### Better Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility
- **Modular Design**: Components can be tested and maintained independently
- **Event-Driven**: Comprehensive event system for monitoring and communication
- **Type Safety**: JSDoc type definitions for better development experience

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Categorized error types (`SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, etc.)
- Detailed error context and suggestions
- Proper error propagation and recovery

#### Improved Device Management
- Centralized device discovery and validation
- Periodic device refresh with caching
- Better permission handling (especially macOS)
- Audio device management from renderer process

#### File Management
- Proper file tracking and registration
- Automatic cleanup of old files
- Storage statistics and monitoring
- Recording completion confirmation workflow

#### Configuration
- Configurable options for each component
- Sensible defaults with override capabilities
- Performance tuning options

### 4. Migration Strategy

The new system maintains **API compatibility** with the existing code:

#### Service Manager Integration
```javascript
// Old way (still works)
const ScreenRecorder = require('../services/screen-recorder');
this.services.screenRecorder = new ScreenRecorder();

// New way
const { createScreenRecorderSystem } = require('../screen-recorder');
const screenRecorderSystem = await createScreenRecorderSystem();
this.services.screenRecorder = screenRecorderSystem.service;
```

#### IPC Handlers
- All existing IPC channels remain the same
- Handlers are now centralized in the new system
- Old handler file moved to `legacy-backup/`

### 5. Files Moved

**Moved to Legacy Backup**:
- `src/main/services/screen-recorder.js` → `src/main/services/legacy-backup/`
- `src/main/ipc-handlers/screen-recorder-handlers.js` → `src/main/services/legacy-backup/`

**Updated Files**:
- `src/main/managers/service-manager.js` - Updated to use new system
- `src/main/managers/ipc-manager.js` - Removed old handler registration

## Benefits

### 1. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand
- Modular design allows for independent testing and debugging
- Comprehensive documentation and type definitions

### 2. Extensibility
- Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
- Plugin-like architecture for new recording formats or storage options
- Event system allows for easy monitoring and integration

### 3. Reliability
- Better error handling and recovery
- Proper resource cleanup and management
- File tracking prevents orphaned recordings

### 4. Performance
- Efficient device caching and refresh strategies
- Automatic cleanup of old files
- Optimized event emission and handling

### 5. Developer Experience
- Type definitions improve IDE support
- Clear API documentation
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Usage Examples

### Basic Recording
```javascript
const result = await screenRecorderService.startRecording({
  screenId: 'screen:0',
  audioInputId: 'default',
  includeMicrophone: true,
  videoQuality: 'medium'
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Recording started:', result.outputPath);
} else {
  console.error('Failed to start recording:', result.error);
}
```

### Device Management
```javascript
// Get available screens
const screens = await screenRecorderService.getAvailableScreens();

// Validate device selection
const validation = screenRecorderService.validateDeviceSelection(screenId, audioId);
if (!validation.valid) {
  console.error('Invalid devices:', validation.issues);
}
```

### Event Monitoring
```javascript
screenRecorderService.on('started', (data) => {
  console.log('Recording started:', data);
});

screenRecorderService.on('completed', (data) => {
  console.log('Recording completed:', data.actualOutputPath);
});

screenRecorderService.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('Recording error:', error);
});
```

## Future Enhancements

The new architecture enables easy implementation of:

1. **Multiple Recording Formats**: Support for MP4, MOV, etc.
2. **Quality Presets**: Predefined recording quality settings
3. **Cloud Storage Integration**: Direct upload to cloud services
4. **Scheduled Recordings**: Time-based recording automation
5. **Advanced Permissions**: Enhanced permission management
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Recording performance metrics
7. **Recording Templates**: Predefined recording configurations

## Testing

The modular design makes testing much easier:

```javascript
// Test individual components
const deviceManager = new DeviceManager();
await deviceManager.initialize();
const screens = await deviceManager.getAvailableScreens();

// Test with mocks
const mockEngine = new MockScreenRecorderEngine();
const service = new ScreenRecorderService();
service.engine = mockEngine;
```

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing IPC channels work unchanged
- Service manager integration remains compatible
- Renderer code requires no changes
- Gradual migration path available

## Conclusion

This restructuring provides a solid foundation for future screen recording enhancements while maintaining compatibility with existing code. The modular design, improved error handling, and comprehensive documentation make the codebase more maintainable and extensible.
