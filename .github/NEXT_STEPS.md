# Post-Restructure Action Items

## Immediate Actions (Optional)

### 1. Test Workflow Execution
- Push a commit or create a PR to trigger the build workflow
- Verify all jobs execute successfully
- Check artifact generation and naming

### 2. Update Package Scripts (If Needed)
Check if any package.json scripts reference old script locations:
```bash
grep -r "scripts/" package.json
```

### 3. External YAML Validation (If Desired)
Install and run a YAML linter for stricter validation:
```bash
npm install -g yaml-lint
yaml-lint .github/workflows/*.yml
yaml-lint .github/workflows/reusable/*.yml
yaml-lint .github/actions/*/action.yml
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Workflow Optimization
- Add caching for build dependencies
- Implement matrix builds for better parallelization
- Add workflow status badges to README

### 2. Quality Gates
- Add security scanning workflows
- Implement automated dependency updates
- Add performance benchmarking

### 3. Release Automation
- Auto-generate changelogs
- Implement semantic versioning
- Add release notes automation

## Monitoring

### Workflow Health
- Monitor build times and success rates
- Set up failure notifications
- Track artifact sizes and build performance

### Maintenance
- Regularly update action versions
- Review and update Node.js versions
- Keep dependencies current
